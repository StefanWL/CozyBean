Dynamic, Interactive and Responsive site, build for an imaginary restaurant.
The website content was designed based on interviews with our target demographic and ux tested with real potential customers.
The website has been built to work seemless on mobile and desktop and be responsive to different screen sizes.
Interactive feedback for users was created using JavaScript and jQuery.
Feedback was tested with real users to improve user experience.
Data for the menu is saved in a MySQL database and is retrieved and rendered to the page using C#/.NET.
Orders to the site update sales values in the database to simulate real values for popular items
