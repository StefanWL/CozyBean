            <h2>We are Community Oriented</h2>
            <p>The Cozy Bean is a brand of food and beverage from Toronto, Canada. It was founded by a group of 5 young coffee enthusiasts on November 2nd, 2021. They started the business together in a modest rented building located in the heart of downtown Toronto, at the intersection of Queens St. West and Bathurst St.</p>
            <p>The Cozy Bean comes from the idea that everyone can enjoy coffee. It doesn’t matter if you like your coffee light and sweet or prefer strong coffee with no sugar; you can always enjoy your coffee with your personal preferences. It’s also a warm and friendly environment that provides an excellent atmosphere to enjoy a great cup of coffee or sandwich, hang with friends or do a bit of work, or simply enjoy live music from great local bands.</p>
