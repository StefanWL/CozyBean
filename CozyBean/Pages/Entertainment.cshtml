            <p class="reduced-text">One signature difference that makes us unique when compared to other coffee shops is our live entertainment every month. We cover everything from live music to comedy which we hope will please every guest that comes to Cozy Bean Coffee. Whether hot or cold weather, the Cozy Bean Cafe is a safe place for every soul out there to go and enjoy the entertainment that we bring to you. The Cozy Bean Cafe is not a regular coffee shop, and it is a place to slow your pace down a bit in this busy big city. </p>
